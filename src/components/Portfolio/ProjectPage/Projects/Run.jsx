On a dark and gloomy night, a player must run and stay out of sight from a monster that's chasing them. The only way to keep distance is to stay out of any light. Destroy lamps and other light sources before running into them, or else the monster will get a better look at the player and will then get one step closer.

                This project evolves from a Unity Environment I previously created when experimenting with post processing effects."
