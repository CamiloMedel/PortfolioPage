                    description="My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how people interact with digital products. I was drawn to the idea of crafting experiences that feel intuitive, thoughtful, and user-centered.

                    In June 2022, I took my first big step by enrolling in the Google UX Design Certificate course. Through it, I was introduced to the foundations of user experience design—learning about user-centered design principles, conducting user research, and building wireframes and interactive prototypes for websites and mobile apps. This experience gave me a strong appreciation for the design side of tech and laid the groundwork for everything I would pursue next."

                    description="In December 2023, I began working through freeCodeCamp’s curriculum while balancing school. I completed the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certifications, which helped me understand how to structure responsive layouts with HTML and CSS and bring interactivity to the browser with JavaScript. It was my first hands-on experience turning designs into working websites, and it gave me the confidence to keep building."

                    description="In July 2023, I enrolled in the Meta Front-End Developer Specialization on Coursera to deepen my understanding of front-end technologies. Over the course of several months, I built on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while diving into React and modern JavaScript libraries for building dynamic web applications.

                    Balancing the coursework alongside my final year of college and a part-time retail job was challenging—but incredibly rewarding. I completed the specialization in March 2025, and by the end, I felt far more confident in my ability to structure, style, and build responsive, component-based user interfaces from the ground up."

                    description="Looking back, this journey has been shaped by steady growth, persistence, and curiosity. Alongside these online programs, I also pursued the Elements of Computing Certificate at UT Austin, which gave me a deeper understanding of programming fundamentals and problem-solving. As I continue developing my skills, I’m now expanding into iOS development, where many of the principles I learned through web development—like component-based design, responsive layouts, and user-first thinking—translate naturally."
