The site features dedicated pages for game prototypes, iOS apps, and reflective dev logs — all unified through a clean, minimal design.

            I designed and developed the site from the ground up, balancing functionality with visual polish. It reflects my background in fine arts and computing, blending technical skills with creative design sensibility.'
